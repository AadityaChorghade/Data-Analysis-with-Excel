# Data-Analysis-with-Excel

The project involved conducting data analysis for Vrinda Stores, a local e-commerce general store. Using Excel's pivot tables function, I analyzed the sales data to gain insights into monthly sales trends, age-wise sales distribution, and demographic sales patterns. Slicers were used to filter the data by different years.

The analysis revealed several key findings. Firstly, it was observed that women accounted for a majority of the sales, with approximately 69% of the total purchases made by female customers. Secondly, the top three contributing states in terms of sales were Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka, collectively accounting for about 35% of the total sales.

Furthermore, it was discovered that the adult age group (30-49 years) made the highest contribution to sales, representing approximately 50% of the total sales. Additionally, the most significant sales channels were Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart, which together contributed to around 80% of the overall sales.

Based on these insights, recommendations were made to target women belonging to the age group of 30-49 years, residing in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka. The strategy suggested offering discounts and promotional offers specifically on Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart to further enhance sales.

Overall, this data analysis project provided valuable insights into customer demographics and sales trends for Vrinda Stores, enabling informed decision-making and the formulation of targeted marketing strategies to drive business growth.
